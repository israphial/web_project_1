# Practicum Web Project 2 by Luke Schmidt

## Overview: 
Web Project 2 is an expansion and refactor of Project 1's codebase. Project 1 focuses on the basics of BEM, such as separating HTML elements into the BEM components, block, element, and modifier. Project 2 expands upon this with the required addition of the Nested BEM file structure, as well as the addition of animations and interactivity.
